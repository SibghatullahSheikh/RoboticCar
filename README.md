# Robotic Car

Welcome to the Robotic Car project of the San Diego Artificial Intelligence study group.

This is a hands-on complement to the Udacity 373 class "Programming a Robotic Car".

We're implementing a controller for Mindstorms NXT models of self driven cars, with a matching simulator to test our algorithms.

We will apply various AI methods similar to those used for full size self driven cars, such as probabilistic inference, computer vision, machine learning, and planning.

The code is implemented in Python, as this is the language used for the class. Other languages may also be used.
